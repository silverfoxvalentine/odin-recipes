<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Take a little soppressata, some chopped Calabrian chiles, and a drizzle of hot honey, and you'll end up with the pizza of the moment. Calabrian chiles, fiery chiles from Italy, 
    add heat and a distinctly fruity flavor to this pie. The hot honey mirrors the flavors of the chiles, and adds a touch of sweetness.

    <li>Make Fresh Shrimp Stock: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add fresh shrimp shells and tails, reserving shrimp for risotto, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and fresh parsley. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Pour water over ingredients; cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable stock and seafood stock in another saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat and keep warm.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add fresh mussels and 1/2 cup white wine. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and allow mussels to steam open; about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove lid from pan and transfer mussels to a large bowl. Pour juice from skillet into Fresh Shrimp Stock; strain stock and remove from heat. Allow mussels to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, remove meat from mussels and discard shells.</li>
    <li>In a large stockpot, heat remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil and butter over medium-low heat. Add white onion and garlic to stockpot and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add calamari to stockpot and saute 1 minute more.</li>
    <li> Add Arborio rice and cook and stir until toasted; about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup white wine, tomatoes, and pasta sauce. Stir in Fresh Shrimp Stock, about 1/2 cup at a time, and cooking and stirring until stock has been absorbed. Continue this method, adding 1/2 cup broth at a time and switching to vegetable stock mixture when necessary, until rice is cooked through, about 18 to 20 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in bay scallops, shrimp, shelled mussels, and parsley.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat. Season sea scallops with salt and pepper. Sear, about 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, or until scallops are cooked through and opaque; do not overcook. Remove from skillet; set aside and keep warm.</li>
    <li> Remove risotto from heat. Divide between 6 plates and top with fresh sea scallops and garnish with additional fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
